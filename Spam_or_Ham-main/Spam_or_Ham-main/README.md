# Logistic Regression Model for Spam Detection

Welcome to the Logistic Regression Model for Spam Detection repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify email messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The model is implemented in R using the caret package.

## Introduction

Email spam is a prevalent issue in today's digital world, causing inconvenience and potential harm to users. Detecting and filtering out spam emails is crucial for maintaining a clean and secure inbox. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to automatically classify emails as spam or ham.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is stored in the file `spam.csv`. This dataset contains a collection of email messages along with their corresponding labels (spam or ham). Each email message is represented as a text document.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

The first step in building the spam detection model involves preprocessing the raw text data. The preprocessing steps include:

- Converting text to lowercase
- Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters
- Removing stopwords (commonly occurring words with little semantic meaning)
- Stripping extra whitespace

### 2. Model Training

Once the data is preprocessed, it is split into training and testing sets. The logistic regression model is then trained using the training set. Logistic regression is a popular choice for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for our spam detection problem.

### 3. Model Evaluation

After training the model, it is evaluated using the testing set. The accuracy of the model is calculated to assess its performance in distinguishing between spam and ham emails. Additionally, other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can be computed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
